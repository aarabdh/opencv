# Open-CV Projects

## line.py
Used this for drawing simple lines and understand how python image processing works.

## circle.py
It is used to create a pixellated effect using circles being drawn over the image, while using the color data from the original image itelf.

## camera.py
Figured out how to take a video input from the in-built Laptop Camera and apply transformations to the frames in real-time.

## phonecam.py
Took similar video input from my phone camera using [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam) on my android phone. I then tried to apply similar transformations to the output successfully.

## primeNumberSpiral.py
Took up the Coding Challenge from [this video from The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a35KWEjRvc0). Also implemented Object Oriented Programming in my code for better readability.
